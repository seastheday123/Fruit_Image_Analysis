# Fruit_Image_Analysis
Final Project Doing Image Analysis on Different Fruits
This project used PCA, MDS, and TSNE scaling to break down images of fruits for Gradiant Boosting, Random Forest, and Regression Analysis of fruit images. The accuracy of these models were compared. 
In addition to these models, a ResNEt50 model was created to compare ML to traditional models. 
Data for this project was from Kaggle using the Fruits 360 data: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/moltean/fruits
